Describes the variables, the data and steps performed to clean up the data 

Variables  and data:

Data used in this analysis were collected from Smartphone-Based Recognition of Human Activities and Postural Transitions Data Set. 30 volunteers that were randomly assigned in two groups (training group made up of 70% or 21 of the volunteers and 30% or 9 of the volunteers). The subjects wore Samsung Galaxy S II, equipped with an Accelerometer and a Gyroscope, on their waist-belt. The activities performed by the subjects were:

•	WALKING 

•	WALKING_UPSTAIRS

•	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

•	SITTING 

•	STANDING 

•	LAYING


The raw signals captured by the accelerometer and gyroscope were the tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ respectively. The acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ), while the Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ) were derived from the body linear acceleration and angular velocity. The magnitude of these three-dimensional signals (in the X, Y, Z directions) were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). Some of the data were also transformed using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to derive fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. The analyzed variables include:
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The final tidy data was only the mean and standard deviation of all the above mentioned variables in each X, Y, Z directions as indicated.


Steps taken to clean up data:

 run_analysis.R is an R- script that gets and cleans data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphonperforms in the following 5 steps described below.  


•	The first step uses the function rbind() to merge the X-train and X-test data into one; to merge the Y-train and Y-test data and well as merge the subject-train and subject-test.

•	The second step extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement and names the extracted columns by their feature names from features.txt.

•	Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

•	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. This is achieved by correctly naming columns with ambiguous names.

•	The final step generates a tidy data of the average measures for each subject and activity type and outputs the result into averages_data.txt.
